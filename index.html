                === is called strick equal and == this is equal <br>
                For 2 == "2", the abstract equality operator returns true because the "2" is converted to the number 2
                before the comparison is made. <br>
                For 2 === "2", the strict equality operator returns false because it sees that the data types are different.

                <h3>var</h3>
                1. var can be redeclared and reinitailize as many times you want.<br>
                2. variable can be hoist which meaning the declearation move at the top of the scope<br>
                3. var has a function scope<br>
                4. var is before the ES6<br>
                <h3>let</h3>
                1. let can't be redeclared but can be reinitailize as many times you want.<br>
                2. let variable cannot be hoisted variable goes into temporal dead zone if we try to access the variable
                before decration.<br>
                3. let has a block scope<br>
                4. let is introdunce in ES6<br>
                <h3>const</h3>
                1. const can't be redeclared or reinitailiz.<br>
                2. const variable cannot be hoisted variable goes into temporal dead zone if we try to access the
                variable before decration.<br>
                3. const has a block scope<br>
                4. const is introdunce in ES6<br>

                hoisting is a phenomina in which interpretator moves the declearation at the top
                scope before code is being execute. Hoisting use to avoid geting the errors <br>
                hosing happen in variable made by var keyword and simple funtions.

                A temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the

        <div class="ans">
            <div class="explaination">
                A function is said to have First-class functions if functions in that language are treated
                like other variables. So the functions can be assigned to any other variable or passed as an argument or
                can be returned by another function.
